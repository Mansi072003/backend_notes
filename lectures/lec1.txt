---------------JAVASCRIPT-----------
=>java script is asyncronous language
=>syncronous means to run line by line
=>asyncronous task in java script is run for the task which is time consuming ans is forced to run in backend
=>to make it syncronous we use promises ,call back function (when we call one function passed inside another function as an argument).

=>javascript is a weakly typed language ,it is object oriented programming language ,versatile langauge,data types can be switched dynamically ,primitive and reference type 


=>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is an open-source, cross-platform framework that is popular and lightweight. Node.js achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests, meaning that it does not wait for I/O requests to return. Node.js is used by many big companies like Netflix and Uber

=>on server side we can do database ,authentiaiton ,input validation, your business logic 

=>we can use node js more than server side code like utility scripts and build tools


=> node role in web development is to create server and listen incoming request  and handle request ,validate input ,connect to database and return responses 


=> why to choose node js as backend
 Node.js is popular because it has a huge, active, open-source, JavaScript-based ecosystem.

 pros of node js :
 it is asyncronous event-driven i/o ,single threadeded , uses javascript ,large community ,wide range of modules
